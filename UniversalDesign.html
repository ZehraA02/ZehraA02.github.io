        <p>
            Universal design is an approach to design that aims to create products, environments, and systems that are accessible, usable, and inclusive for people of all abilities, ages, and backgrounds. The goal of universal design is to make the designed elements as functional and welcoming as possible for the widest range of users, without the need for specialized adaptations or accommodations. <br/>
            <br/>
            Universal design principles are often applied in various fields, including architecture, product design, digital technology, transportation, and more. For example, in the context of technology and web design, universal design principles can lead to the development of websites and applications that are accessible to people with disabilities, ensuring equal access to information and services for all users. By adopting universal design principles, designers and developers aim to create a more inclusive and equitable world where everyone can participate fully in society and enjoy equal opportunities and access to various services and products.  <br/>
            Some examples of universally designed products are smartphones, automated doors, e-books.
